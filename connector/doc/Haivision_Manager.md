- **Health & Status Monitoring**: Real-time device state (online/offline, error status)  
- **Telemetry & Metrics Collection**: Network, throughput, stream statistics 
- **Configuration & Metadata Sync**: Fetch device settings, firmware versions, and other metadata  
- **Alerts & Events**: Capture logs 


## Key features

### Monitor devices
Effortlessly monitor all your connected devices in real time. The Haivision Manager provides a comprehensive overview of every online device, including detailed information such as device identifiers, hardware IDs, product types, versions, encoder counts, mission assignments, and even GPS location. Instantly see which devices are active and access their current operational status, ensuring you have full visibility and control over your network at all times.

### Monitor outputs
Gain complete control over your media outputs with advanced monitoring capabilities. The Haivision Manager allows you to track the status of all output types—NDI, IP, and SDI—across your infrastructure. For each output, you can view its current state (Play, Pauze or Stop), locking status, input details, and associated device information. With integrated Play and Stop stream commands, you can start or halt media streams directly from the management interface, enabling rapid response and seamless workflow management. You can also Play or Stop a stream on the output.
