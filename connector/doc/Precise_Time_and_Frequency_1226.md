# Precise Time and Frequency 1226

## About

This connector is designed to interface with the Precise Time and Frequency 1226 system, enabling users to access and manage its high-stability time and frequency signals. Through SNMP and Telnet protocols, the connector supports monitoring and configuration of device parameters, ensuring precise synchronization and dependable performance for critical applications.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Operational Status Monitoring**: Provides real-time visibility into the status of all outputs, inputs, and auxiliary channels. Users can quickly identify channel conditions (okay, fault, or inactive) to ensure system reliability and reduce downtime.

- **Configurable Channel Control**: Supports direct configuration of channels within the Operational Status table. Operators can activate or inactivate specific outputs, inputs, or auxiliary channels as required, enabling flexible system management and streamlined troubleshooting.

- **Voltage Supervision Across All Channels**: Continuously monitors the voltage levels of outputs, inputs, and auxiliary channels. This ensures stable performance, helps detect anomalies early, and supports proactive maintenance to maintain signal accuracy and system integrity.

- **Fault Detection and Alerts**: Able to monitor and alarm abnormal conditions, such as channel faults or voltage irregularities, enabling faster incident response and minimizing system disruption.
