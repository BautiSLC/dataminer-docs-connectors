# NTT Electronics HC32000E

## About

The NTT Electronics HC32000E is a high-density video encoder designed for real-time transmission of multiple HD and 4K UHD streams using HEVC (H.265) or H.264 (AVC) compression. It enables simultaneous encoding of up to 2 x 4K or 8 x HD video streams in a compact 1RU chassis, delivering broadcast-quality video with high efficiency and support for complex audio workflows.

### Key Features

- **High-Density Multi-Channel Encoding**: Supports up to 8 HD or 2 4K streams simultaneously in a 1RU unit, maximizing space and efficiency for large-scale deployments.

- **Advanced HEVC/H.264 Video Compression**: Delivers exceptional video quality at low bitrates using the latest encoding standards, supporting both 4:2:2 10-bit and 4:2:0 8-bit color sampling.

- **Extensive Audio Channel Support**: Encodes up to 64 discrete audio channels, enabling multi-language and multitrack audio workflows for live broadcasts.

- **Flexible Input & Output Interfaces**: Accepts HD-SDI/3G-SDI inputs and outputs transport streams over DVB-ASI and IP (IPv4/IPv6), with support for up to 4 TS outputs.

- **Robust Redundancy & Stream Protection**: Dual power supplies, seamless IP redundancy, and error correction (FEC, ARQ) ensure uninterrupted live streaming and contribution feeds.

- **Integrated Security & Encryption**: Supports BISS-1, BISS-E, and BISS-CA encryption for secure transmission over public or private networks.

## Use Cases

### Remote Monitoring and Network Management

**Challenge:** Broadcasters need to cover multiple live HD or UHD video feeds from a venue using minimal rack space, while ensuring redundancy and reliability.

**Solution:** Deploy the HC32000E to encode multiple camera feeds simultaneously within a single 1RU unit, transmitting over IP or ASI to master control.

**Benefit:** Reduces hardware footprint and power consumption, simplifies deployment, and ensures high-reliability transmission with integrated protection mechanisms.

## Technical Reference

### Prerequisites

- **DataMiner version 10.3 or higher** is required.
