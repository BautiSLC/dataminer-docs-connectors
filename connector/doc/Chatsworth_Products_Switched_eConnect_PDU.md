# Chatsworth Products Switched eConnect PDU

## About

Switched eConnect PDUs provide remote monitoring of power at the rack level and individual outlet control, making it possible to remotely turn power on or off at each outlet. It is designed for advanced data center power management and can be controlled remotely via web or SNMP to turn individual outlets on/off or reboot devices. The connector functions as a monitoring tool of the Switched eConnect PDU. It monitors information such as the PDU Branch, Outlets, and Sensors.

## Key Features

- **Outlet monitoring & Configuration**: Monitor and alarm important KPIs for the outlets on the PDU as well as setting the Power-On and Reset delay times.

- **Door monitoring & Configuration**: Monitor and alarm Door status/configuration indicators and configure lock times ans open times for a door.

- **Monitor Sensor status**: Monitor the temperature and humidity of specific sensors.

- **Monitor PDU Branch**: Monitor the the status of different branches in the PDU (i.e Voltage, Current, Power).

## Use Cases

### Per‑Outlet Monitoring

**Challenge**: Monitoring all outlets form a single place.

**Solution**: Dataminer provides precise tracking of voltage, current, power usage, and power factor for each device or circuit.

**Benefit**: Load balancing and efficiency calculations.

### Environmental & Sensor Monitoring

**Challenge**: Monitoring Sensor status values form a single source.

**Solution**: Dataminer provides a simple and clean look of the Temperature and Humidity values for each probe.

**Benefit**: Monitoring environmental conditions at rack-level helps maintain ASHRAE-recommended conditions without overcooling—and conserve energy.
