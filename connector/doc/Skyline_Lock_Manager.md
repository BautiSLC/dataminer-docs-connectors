# Skyline Lock Manager

## About

The Skyline Lock Manager connector allows the management of locks within a DataMiner System for any kind of object by providing a centralized manager accessible through a public API.

## Key Features

- **DataMiner Systemâ€“wide locking**: Any component in the DMS can request a lock for an object.

- **Lock any object type**: Any real or virtual object can be locked, as long as the lock requesters give it the same ID.

- **Link objects**: Objects and their locks can be linked to each other, allowing more in-depth lock management.

## Use Cases

### Updating a DOM Instance

**Challenge**: Imagine two scripts, running simultaneously on different Agents, trying to update the same DOM instance. The risk exists that the second script overwrites the changes made by the first script.

**Solution**: By first asking the Skyline Lock Manager for a lock to the DOM instance, both scripts know whether they can read and update the DOM instance or if they have to wait until the lock becomes available.

**Benefit**: Zero risk of overwriting changes to the DOM instance.

### Writing to a File

**Challenge**: Imagine multiple element running the same connector, writing custom logging to the same hard-coded text file. In theory, multiple elements might be trying to write to the file at the exact same time, causing I/O exceptions.

**Solution**: By first asking the Skyline Lock Manager for a lock to the file, all elements know whether they can write to the file or if they have to wait until the lock becomes available.

**Benefit**: Zero risk of I/O exceptions when writing to the same file.

## Technical Reference

### Prerequisites

To make sure other components in your DataMiner System can communicate with this connector, the **[Skyline Lock Manager ConnectorAPI Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Skyline.DataMiner.ConnectorAPI.SkylineLockManager/)** must be installed.
