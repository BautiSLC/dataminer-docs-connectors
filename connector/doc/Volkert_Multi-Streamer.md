# Volkert Multi-Streamer

## About

Multi-Streamer (by Volkert Software) is a cross-platform application for handling real-time multimedia streams. This connector monitors all media source details and allows users to add or remove media sources as well as pause or mute them.

## Key Features

- **Real-time monitoring**: View all media sources and monitor their health in one go.

## Use Cases

### Ad-hoc monitoring

**Challenge**: Checking the health or details of a stream on the network is not always easy to do on the fly or requires probing equipment.

**Solution**: With this connector for the Volkert Multi-Streamer, you can easily and quickly tune in on an existing stream from within DataMiner.

**Benefit**: Real-time monitoring with a full detailed overview with ad hoc setup capabilities.

## Technical Info

### Prerequisites

- **External Remote Control**: In the Volkert Multi-Streamer application, open *Settings* > *Remote Control*. Enable **Allow to remote control this instance** and set a control password.  
This password must then be entered in the connector on the **General** page so the connector can successfully retrieve the stream details.
