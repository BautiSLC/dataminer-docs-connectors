# SatPort Incident Manager

## About

The purpose of this connector is to listen to the ticketing application.  
When a new ticket is detected, it automatically attempts to forward it to iPaaS.

**What is iPaaS?**  
iPaaS (Integration Platform as a Service) is a cloud-based integration layer that connects different applications, systems, and data sources.  
In this case, it acts as a bridge between the ticketing system and the external platform ServiceNow, enabling seamless data exchange and automation.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Connection – [Name of the connection]

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- IP address/host: The iPaaS endpoint URL (e.g., `https://apim-integration-dev-weu.azure-api.net/itsm/tickets`)  
- IP port: The port of the destination (e.g., `443`)  

### Initialization

After configuring the iPaaS URL, the following parameters must be set under the **Configuration** page:

- **Tenant ID** – The GUID of your tenant (provided by the APIM Administrator).  
- **API App ID** – The GUID of the APIM Front registration (provided by the APIM Administrator).  
- **Client ID** – The GUID of your app registration in Azure (provided by the APIM Administrator).  
- **Client Secret App** – The client secret of your Azure app registration (provided by the APIM Administrator).  
- **Subscription Key** – The `Ocp-Apim` subscription key (provided by the APIM Administrator).  

## How to Use

1. Provide all required input parameters described above.  
2. Verify the **Authentication** parameter – once it shows **OK**, it means the connector successfully communicated with your iPaaS and retrieved a valid token.  
3. This token is automatically used whenever a new ticket is sent to iPaaS.  

On the **General** page, you’ll find the **Ticket Subscription Table**, where you can enable or disable forwarding of tickets based on their type.  

This allows you to control which ticket types are synchronized with iPaaS.
