# Vertiv EXL S1

## About

The Vertiv EXL S1 connector enables data integration and monitoring of Vertiv's high-efficiency uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system, the EXL S1 series. This connector retrieves operational and performance data via SNMP from the UPS, including parameters such as input/output voltage, battery status, bypass, alarms, and configuration. The source of the data is the UPS's SNMP interface, which must be correctly configured and reachable on the network.

## Key Features

- **Unified Integration**: Enables communication between Dataminer and any Vertiv EXL S1 UPS.

- **24/7 Monitoring**: Constant monitoring to support continuous status updates.

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1

**Challenge**: Operators need to centrally monitor many Vertiv EXL S1 UPS devices spread over multiple sites to ensure continuous uptime.

**Solution**: Use the Vertiv EXL S1 connector to integrate these devices into Dataminer, enabling real-time off-site monitoring.

**Benefit**: Improves uptime and reliabilty by allowing for proactive issue detections and early awareness of system alarms.
